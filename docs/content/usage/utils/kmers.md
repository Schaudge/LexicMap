```plain
$ lexicmap utils kmers -h
View k-mers captured by the masks

Attentions:
  1. Mask index (column mask) is 1-based.
  2. K-mer positions (column pos) are 1-based.
     For reference genomes with multiple sequences, the sequences were
     concatenated to a single sequence with intervals of N's.

Usage:
  lexicmap utils kmers [flags] -d <index path> [-m <mask index>] [-o out.tsv.gz]

Flags:
  -h, --help              help for kmers
  -d, --index string      ► Index directory created by "lexicmap index".
  -m, --mask int          ► View k-mers captured by Xth mask. (0 for all) (default 1)
  -o, --out-file string   ► Out file, supports and recommends a ".gz" suffix ("-" for stdout).
                          (default "-")

Global Flags:
  -X, --infile-list string   ► File of input files list (one file per line). If given, they are
                             appended to files from CLI arguments.
      --log string           ► Log file.
      --quiet                ► Do not print any verbose information. But you can write them to a file
                             with --log.
  -j, --threads int          ► Number of CPUs cores to use. By default, it uses all available cores.
                             (default 16)
